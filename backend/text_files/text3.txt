I think I am being followed.
Our conversations might be intercepted, so I had to use vault steganography to communicate with you.
Yesterday on my way back home I saw a black SUV that kept following me.
So I had to take the next underground tube to loose my traces.

I got on the Jubilee line and got off at Bermondsey.

So strange when I call people I hear static noises before the call connects, therefore I am suspicious my calls might be tracked.
I dumped my SIM card just in case.
I think this is to do with the investigation we are conducting about the cyber attack that happened last week Sunday at 01:00
Whoever is behind this does not want us to discover where the attack came from and by which malicious hacker group.

I kept a copy of the logs, ids & ips reports, SIEM alerts and anything related to the attack inside a hard drive in my secure room.
Seems like the attackers used privilege escalation to gain access to the root and left a backdoor open.

To get to the secure room, do the following:

1 - Go to the shed in my back yard
2 - Open the fuse box and pull down the 2nd and 5th fuses from the left.
3 - This should open the passage to the basement where the storage is located. Hard drive is in there.
4 - Password is the name of the famous book George Orwell wrote. (1984)

I am getting out of town for a while. You know what to do. Be careful.

Xenon.
